        <h1>Useful things for you to know</h1>
        <p>Whether you’re looking to fill an entire day with touristic events and activities, or looking to sightsee your way around the city, there’s variety of activities to occupy yourself with. I’m sure you won’t get bored during your stay.
If it’s your first time in Stockholm, worry not if you’re not familiar with the area or can’t find your way around – there are many ‘Tourist Information’ spots dotted around the city to help people like you get around. In some of Stockholm’s main locations of Cityterminalen or Djurgården you will find kiosks handing out maps and professionals informing people about any different places to visit.

       <div class="ti-info2">
         <p>Sometimes, planning a trip may be a more of a chore than an exciting activity. In most situations, having a plan of places to see and things to do is the most intuitive way of tackling a trip – a plan would allow you to see a place as it is recommended by locals/ travel experts, eat handpicked cultural cuisines and travel along paths in the timeliest manner.
If you’re on holiday, you’re at the place for a selected period of time, you want to see it in its entirety, time management is key.
However, there’s always this inkling, this temptation of “going in blind”, going somewhere without a plan of “where to go” and “what to see”. Allowing the place to reveal itself to you in its entirety without you ever having any expectations of it based on what you’ve read about or what you’ve watched. Sometimes, just sometimes, go in “blind” and see the place for yourself. Cultivate your own thoughts, experience it your way.

        <h4>With Stockholm being so vast, you’d find that walking would sometimes seem unreasonable.
Stockholm’s transportation links allow you to reach your destination in a variety of methods suited to you. However you aim to travel; buses, trains, trams, and even boats are all available options connecting you between the interlocked Swedish islands.
        Stockholm’s main organisation overlooking the entire transportation sector is ‘SL’ – ‘Storstockholms Lokaltrafik’. If you want to use Stockholm’s public transport system, SL can provide you with cards you can top up and use to get by on transport links.

  Walking is always an option. It’s free, it’s healthy and it takes you at your own pace. Stockholm is very walkable. You can walk almost everywhere within the Swedish Capital within a day – just if you’re planning in doing so, wear comfortable shoes…as said before.
  However, if your main day is intent upon walking, or specifically hiking, then there are walking routes which would last you a day or more. The main ones being “Roslagsleden”, “Sörmlandsleden” and “Upplandsleden”.
