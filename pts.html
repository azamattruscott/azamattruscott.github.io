         <span><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 1vw;">Keep an open mind, you don’t quite know where life may take you. Cherish each memory, there’s a reason we’re all taken down our own paths. Exploring is not a spontaneous decision, it’s an instinct; to know your surroundings, to know where you stand, what’s around you, you must physically be present in the space; feel its vibe, its atmosphere, judge its dynamic, take it as it is without expecting more from it.
Subconsciously, you will gravitate towards whatever that interests you. Therefore, whichever path you choose to take, whichever place you choose to travel, everything will be predefined decision based on your character. If you want to know who you are, then I urge you to travel more, make spontaneous plans, meet with people you’ve never met before, absorb the wealth of various cultures. Keep your memories. You may not know who you are, but by looking back, connecting the dots, you’ll be a step closer to finding out. This was all because you chose to explore. Explore that which is outside of you, and everything about you.

       <div class="pts-info3">
         <h4>Nature is inspiring. It allows one to unify themselves with the elements, become momentarily present with their location and with their mind. Ingeniously, nature may have perhaps inspired the entire nation of Scandinavia. Cold, densely packed forests inspired a design movement that not only had a regional impact, but also a global one. Open spaces, brightly coloured décor, functional design is all found within Swedish living spaces; and most certainly in your choice of accommodation.
Wherever you choose to travel, in whichever place you choose to stay in, nature is implemented within the design of every area… unless you choose to camp out in the wilderness, you’ll practically get the whole outdoor experience.
When it comes to design, functionality isn’t an independent expression sparked by a lingering thought, it’s more of an incorporation, a means to suit an entire population, a humble statement exclaiming its service to everyone, for every occasion.
